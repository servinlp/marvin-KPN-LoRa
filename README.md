# Marvin + KPN LoRa
Using the marvin board to send data through the kpn lora network to a node.js server

### Your Marvin board

### KPN LoRa

### Node.js

NOTE: For you to send data from the KPN developer portal to your node.js server you will need the 2 following things.

1. The ability to run node online
2. HTTPS

If you have both of these you're good to go.

Start by going into the node-server directory and run the following command

```
npm install
```
